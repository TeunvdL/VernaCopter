[{"role": "system", "content": "You are an assistant guiding a drone to perform an instruction specified by a user.\nYour task is to take the user's instruction and translate it into a specification in Signal Temporal Logic (STL).\nYou are provided with a dictionary of objects in the scene, the available Logic functions, and logic operators that you can use in your generated STL specification. All of these are provided below.\n\nObjects dictionary, containing object names and their bounding boxes: {object name: (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax)}:\n    {'goal': (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0), 'obstacle1': (-3.0, -1.0, -0.5, 1.5, 0.5, 2.5), 'obstacle2': (-4.5, -3.0, 0.0, 2.25, 0.5, 2.0), 'obstacle3': (-2.0, -1.0, 4.0, 5.0, 3.5, 4.5), 'obstacle4': (3.0, 4.0, -3.5, -2.5, 1.0, 2.0), 'obstacle5': (4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.5), 'obstacle6': (2.0, 3.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.75, 5.0), 'obstacle7': (-2.0, -1.0, -2.0, -1.0, 1.0, 2.0)}\n\nLogic functions: \n    \"STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(bounds)\", \"STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(bounds)\"\n\nLogic operators:\n    and/conjunction: \"&\", \n    or/disjunction: \"|\"\n\nSTL specifications are represented as Python objects. some temporal functions operate on these objects. The syntax is like \"specification.function()\"\nThe available temporal functions are shown below.\n\nTemporal functions:\n    \"eventually(t1, t2)\", \"always(t1, t2)\", \"until(other, t1, t2)\"\n\nA time horizon is also provided, which is the maximum time that the solver considers. Do not use a value for time larger than that value. You are allowed to use smaller values.\nTime horizon (maximum time for solver) = 35\n\nNote that every specification requires a temporal function to operate on it: \n\"STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"goal1\"]).eventually(0, 5)\" will work, but \"STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"goal1\"])\" won't.\n\nAlso specifically note that negation is not defined. So ~ cannot be used.\n\nYour interaction with the user will be in conversation style. You should ask questions to get more insight into the task. \nALWAYS ask at least one question to get more information. Usually, more questions should be asked to gain enough information.\nBe aware of the objects in the scene. Use the names of the objects in the objects dictionary and ask questions relevant to these objects:\nShould they be avoided? Should the drone stay within a certain region? What else can be interesting about the objects?\nInform the user about the insights you've gained regarding the environment.\n\nOnce you have gained enough information, \n1. Describe in parts how the task will be fulfilled\n2. return the final specification between \"<\" and \">\" brackets so that the system can extract the specification successfully. Only put the final specification in brackets.\n\nAn example of a user input and the appropriate STL specification is shown below:\nUser: The drone should reach the goal and avoid the obstacle. Specification: <STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"goal\"]).eventually(0, 35) & STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"obstacle\"]).always(0, 35)>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Go to the goal"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To ensure the drone reaches the goal, I need to know if there are any specific constraints or obstacles that the drone should avoid on its way to the goal.\n\nAre there any obstacles in the scene that the drone should avoid while reaching the goal? If so, could you specify which ones?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The drone should avoid all obstacles."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you for the information. To summarize, the drone needs to:\n1. Reach the goal.\n2. Avoid all the obstacles in the scene.\n\nHere are the objects in the scene:\n- Goal: (4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0)\n- Obstacles: obstacle1, obstacle2, obstacle3, obstacle4, obstacle5, obstacle6, obstacle7\n\nThe task will be fulfilled in the following parts:\n1. The drone must eventually reach the goal.\n2. The drone must always stay outside the bounding boxes of all obstacles.\n\nNow, I will create the STL specification for this task.\n\n1. The drone must eventually reach the goal:\n   ```STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"goal\"]).eventually(0, 35)```\n\n2. The drone must always avoid each obstacle:\n   ```STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"obstacle1\"]).always(0, 35)```\n   ```STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"obstacle2\"]).always(0, 35)```\n   ```STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"obstacle3\"]).always(0, 35)```\n   ```STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"obstacle4\"]).always(0, 35)```\n   ```STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"obstacle5\"]).always(0, 35)```\n   ```STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"obstacle6\"]).always(0, 35)```\n   ```STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"obstacle7\"]).always(0, 35)```\n\nCombining these, the final STL specification is:\n<STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"goal\"]).eventually(0, 35) & STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"obstacle1\"]).always(0, 35) & STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"obstacle2\"]).always(0, 35) & STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"obstacle3\"]).always(0, 35) & STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"obstacle4\"]).always(0, 35) & STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"obstacle5\"]).always(0, 35) & STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"obstacle6\"]).always(0, 35) & STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"obstacle7\"]).always(0, 35)>"}]
