[{"role": "system", "content": "You are an assistant guiding a drone to perform an instruction specified by a user.\nYour task is to take the user's instruction and translate it into a specification in Signal Temporal Logic (STL).\nYou are provided with a dictionary of objects in the scene, the available Logic functions, and logic operators that you can use in your generated STL specification. All of these are provided below.\n\nObjects dictionary, containing object names and their bounding boxes: {object name: (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax)}:\n    {'door_key': (3.75, 4.75, 3.75, 4.75, 1.0, 2.0), 'chest': (-4.25, -3, -4.5, -3.75, 0.0, 0.75), 'door': (0.0, 0.5, -2.5, -1, 0.0, 2.5), 'region_bounds': (-5.0, 5.0, -5.0, 5.0, 0.0, 3.0), 'NE_inside_wall': (2.0, 5.0, 3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 3.0), 'south_mid_inside_wall': (0.0, 0.5, -5.0, -2.5, 0.0, 3.0), 'north_mid_inside_wall': (0.0, 0.5, -1.0, 5.0, 0.0, 3.0), 'west_inside_wall': (-2.25, -1.75, -5.0, 3.5, 0.0, 3.0), 'above_door_wall': (0.0, 0.5, -2.5, -1, 2.5, 3.0)}\n\nLogic functions: \n    \"STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(bounds)\", \"STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(bounds)\"\n\nLogic operators:\n    and/conjunction: \"&\", \n    or/disjunction: \"|\"\n\nSTL specifications are represented as Python objects. some temporal functions operate on these objects. The syntax is like \"specification.function()\"\nThe available temporal functions are shown below.\n\nTemporal functions:\n    \"eventually(t1, t2)\", \"always(t1, t2)\", \"until(other, t1, t2)\"\n\nA time horizon is also provided, which is the maximum time that the solver considers. Do not use a value for time larger than that value. You are allowed to use smaller values.\nTime horizon (maximum time for solver) = 71\n\nNote that every specification requires a temporal function to operate on it: \n\"STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"goal1\"]).eventually(0, 5)\" will work, but \"STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"goal1\"])\" won't.\n\nYour interaction with the user will be in conversation style. You should ask questions to get more insight into the task. \nALWAYS ask at least one question to get more information. Usually, more questions should be asked to gain enough information.\nBe aware of the objects in the scene. Use the names of the objects in the objects dictionary and ask questions relevant to these objects:\nShould they be avoided? Should the drone stay within a certain region? What else can be interesting about the objects?\nInform the user about the insights you've gained regarding the environment.\n\nOnce you have gained enough information, \n1. Describe in parts how the task will be fulfilled\n2. return the final specification between \"<\" and \">\" brackets so that the system can extract the specification successfully. Only put the final specification in brackets.\n\nAn example of a user input and the appropriate STL specification is shown below:\nUser: The drone should reach the goal and avoid the obstacle. Specification: <STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"goal\"]).eventually(0, 71) & STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"obstacle\"]).always(0, 71)>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please go to the key"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Should the drone stay within a certain region while going to the key?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "stay in the room"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Are there any specific obstacles or boundaries within the room that the drone should avoid while going to the key?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "avoid all walls"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To fulfill the task of going to the key while avoiding all walls and staying in the room, the specification can be divided into two parts:\n1. Ensure the drone goes to the key:\n    - The drone should eventually reach the key location.\n2. Ensure the drone avoids all walls and stays in the room:\n    - The drone should always stay within the room and outside of all walls.\n\nPutting these together, the final specification is:\n\n<STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"door_key\"]).eventually(0, 71) & STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"region_bounds\"]).always(0, 71) & STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"NE_inside_wall\"]).always(0, 71) & STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"south_mid_inside_wall\"]).always(0, 71) & STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"north_mid_inside_wall\"]).always(0, 71) & STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"west_inside_wall\"]).always(0, 71) & STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"above_door_wall\"]).always(0, 71)>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "good.
