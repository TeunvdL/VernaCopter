[{"role": "system", "content": "You are an assistant guiding a drone to perform an instruction specified by a user.\nYour task is to take the user's instruction and translate it into a specification in Signal Temporal Logic (STL).\nYou are provided with a dictionary of objects in the scene, the available Logic functions, and logic operators that you can use in your generated STL specification. All of these are provided below.\n\nObjects dictionary, containing object names and their bounding boxes: {object name: (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax)}:\n    {'door_key': (3.75, 4.75, 3.75, 4.75, 1.0, 2.0), 'chest': (-4.25, -3, -4.5, -3.75, 0.0, 0.75), 'door': (0.0, 0.5, -2.5, -1, 0.0, 2.5), 'room_bounds': (-5.0, 5.0, -5.0, 5.0, 0.0, 3.0), 'NE_inside_wall': (2.0, 5.0, 3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 3.0), 'south_mid_inside_wall': (0.0, 0.5, -5.0, -2.5, 0.0, 3.0), 'north_mid_inside_wall': (0.0, 0.5, -1.0, 5.0, 0.0, 3.0), 'west_inside_wall': (-2.25, -1.75, -5.0, 3.5, 0.0, 3.0), 'above_door_wall': (0.0, 0.5, -2.5, -1, 2.5, 3.0)}\n\nLogic functions: \n    \"STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(bounds)\", \"STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(bounds)\"\n\nLogic operators:\n    and/conjunction: \"&\", \n    or/disjunction: \"|\"\n\nSTL specifications are represented as Python objects. some temporal functions operate on these objects. The syntax is like \"specification.function()\"\nThe available temporal functions are shown below.\n\nTemporal functions:\n    \"eventually(t1, t2)\", \"always(t1, t2)\", \"until(other, t1, t2)\"\n\nA time horizon is also provided, which is the maximum time that the solver considers. Do not use a value for time larger than that value. You are allowed to use smaller values.\nTime horizon (maximum time for solver) = 100\n\nNote that every specification requires a temporal function to operate on it: \n\"STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"goal1\"]).eventually(0, 5)\" will work, but \"STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"goal1\"])\" won't.\n\nAlso specifically note that negation is not defined. So ~ cannot be used.\n\nYour interaction with the user will be in conversation style. You should ask questions to get more insight into the task. \nALWAYS ask at least one question to get more information. Usually, more questions should be asked to gain enough information.\nBe aware of the objects in the scene. Use the names of the objects in the objects dictionary and ask questions relevant to these objects:\nShould they be avoided? Should the drone stay within a certain region? What else can be interesting about the objects?\nInform the user about the insights you've gained regarding the environment.\n\nOnce you have gained enough information, \n1. Describe in parts how the task will be fulfilled\n2. return the final specification between \"<\" and \">\" brackets so that the system can extract the specification successfully. Only put the final specification in brackets.\n\nAn example of a user input and the appropriate STL specification is shown below:\nUser: The drone should reach the goal and avoid the obstacle.

There are no further time constraints"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To ensure I understand your requirements correctly, let me ask a few questions:\n\n1. Should the drone avoid any specific objects while it is navigating to the key and the door?\n2. Should the drone stay within the room bounds during the entire operation?\n3. Is there any specific time frame within which the drone should reach the key and the door, or is it just that the drone should reach the key first and then the door without any specific time constraints?\n\nThese questions will help me understand the constraints and requirements better."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Go to the key in the first 30 seconds and then go to the chest. Avoid all walls and stay in the room. Do not go through the door before you reach the key."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you for the detailed information. Here's how I understand the task:\n\n1. The drone should first go to the key within the first 30 seconds.\n2. After reaching the key, the drone should go to the chest.\n3. The drone should avoid all walls.\n4. The drone should stay within the room bounds.\n5. The drone should not go through the door before reaching the key.\n\nLet's break down the task into parts:\n\n1. **Reach the key within the first 30 seconds:**\n   - The drone should be inside the bounding box of the key within 30 seconds.\n\n2. **Go to the chest after reaching the key:**\n   - The drone should be inside the bounding box of the chest eventually after reaching the key.\n\n3. **Avoid all walls:**\n   - The drone should always stay outside the bounding boxes of all the walls.\n\n4. **Stay within the room bounds:**\n   - The drone should always stay inside the room bounds.\n\n5. **Do not go through the door before reaching the key:**\n   - The drone should always stay outside the door's bounding box until it reaches the key.\n\nNow, let's combine these parts into the final STL specification.\n\n```python\n# Reach the key within the first 30 seconds\nreach_key = STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"door_key\"]).eventually(0, 30)\n\n# Go to the chest after reaching the key\nreach_chest = STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"chest\"]).eventually(30, 100)\n\n# Avoid all walls\navoid_walls = (\n    STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"NE_inside_wall\"]).always(0, 100) &\n    STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"south_mid_inside_wall\"]).always(0, 100) &\n    STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"north_mid_inside_wall\"]).always(0, 100) &\n    STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"west_inside_wall\"]).always(0, 100) &\n    STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"above_door_wall\"]).always(0, 100)\n)\n\n# Stay within the room bounds\nstay_in_room = STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"room_bounds\"]).always(0, 100)\n\n# Do not go through the door before reaching the key\navoid_door_before_key = STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"door\"]).until(STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"door_key\"]), 0, 100)\n\n# Final specification\nfinal_specification = reach_key & reach_chest & avoid_walls & stay_in_room & avoid_door_before_key\n```\n\nThe final STL specification is:\n\n<STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"door_key\"]).eventually(0, 30) & STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"chest\"]).eventually(30, 100) & STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"NE_inside_wall\"]).always(0, 100) & STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"south_mid_inside_wall\"]).always(0, 100) & STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"north_mid_inside_wall\"]).always(0, 100) & STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"west_inside_wall\"]).always(0, 100) & STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"above_door_wall\"]).always(0, 100) & STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"room_bounds\"]).always(0, 100) & STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"door\"]).until(STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"door_key\"]), 0, 100)>"}]
