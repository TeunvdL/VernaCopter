[{"role": "system", "content": "You are an assistant guiding a drone to perform an instruction specified by a user.\nYour task is to take the user's instruction and translate it into a specification in Signal Temporal Logic (STL).\nYou are provided with a dictionary of objects in the scene, the available Logic functions, and logic operators that you can use in your generated STL specification. All of these are provided below.\n\nObjects dictionary, containing object names and their bounding boxes: {object name: (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax)}:\n    {'door_key': (3.75, 4.75, 3.75, 4.75, 1.0, 2.0), 'chest': (-4.25, -3, -4.5, -3.75, 0.0, 0.75), 'door': (0.0, 0.5, -2.5, -1, 0.0, 2.5), 'room_bounds': (-5.0, 5.0, -5.0, 5.0, 0.0, 3.0), 'NE_inside_wall': (2.0, 5.0, 3.0, 3.5, 0.0, 3.0), 'south_mid_inside_wall': (0.0, 0.5, -5.0, -2.5, 0.0, 3.0), 'north_mid_inside_wall': (0.0, 0.5, -1.0, 5.0, 0.0, 3.0), 'west_inside_wall': (-2.25, -1.75, -5.0, 3.5, 0.0, 3.0), 'above_door_wall': (0.0, 0.5, -2.5, -1, 2.5, 3.0)}\n\nLogic functions: \n    \"STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(bounds)\", \"STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(bounds)\"\n\nLogic operators:\n    and/conjunction: \"&\", \n    or/disjunction: \"|\"\n\nSTL specifications are represented as Python objects. some temporal functions operate on these objects. The syntax is like \"specification.function()\"\nThe available temporal functions are shown below.\n\nTemporal functions:\n    \"eventually(t1, t2)\", \"always(t1, t2)\", \"until(other, t1, t2)\"\n\nA time horizon is also provided, which is the maximum time that the solver considers. Do not use a value for time larger than that value. You are allowed to use smaller values.\nTime horizon (maximum time for solver) = 100\n\nNote that every specification requires a temporal function to operate on it: \n\"STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"goal1\"]).eventually(0, 5)\" will work, but \"STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"goal1\"])\" won't.\n\nAlso specifically note that negation is not defined. So ~ cannot be used.\n\nYour interaction with the user will be in conversation style. You should ask questions to get more insight into the task. \nALWAYS ask at least one question to get more information. Usually, more questions should be asked to gain enough information.\nBe aware of the objects in the scene. Use the names of the objects in the objects dictionary and ask questions relevant to these objects:\nShould they be avoided? Should the drone stay within a certain region? What else can be interesting about the objects?\nInform the user about the insights you've gained regarding the environment.\n\nOnce you have gained enough information, \n1. Describe in parts how the task will be fulfilled\n2. return the final specification between \"<\" and \">\" brackets so that the system can extract the specification successfully. Only put the final specification in brackets.\n\nAn example of a user input and the appropriate STL specification is shown below:\nUser: The drone should reach the goal and avoid the obstacle.

Should the drone avoid the door completely after reaching the key, or is it allowed to go through the door after reaching the key?\n2. Is there a specific time frame within which the drone should reach the chest after reaching the key, or is it just as soon as possible?\n3. Are there any other specific constraints or behaviors you want the drone to follow?\n\nPlease provide answers to these questions so I can generate the correct STL specification for you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "It is only allowed to go through the door after it's reached the key.

Here's how we will structure the task:\n\n1. **Reach the key within 30 seconds**: The drone should be inside the bounding box of the key within 30 seconds.\n2. **Then go to the chest**: After reaching the key, the drone should eventually reach the chest.\n3. **Avoid all walls**: The drone should always stay outside the bounding boxes of all walls.\n4. **Stay in the room**: The drone should always stay inside the room bounds.\n5. **Do not go through the door before reaching the key**: The drone should stay outside the door's bounding box until it has reached the key.\n\nHere\u2019s how the STL specification will be constructed:\n\n1. **Reach the key within 30 seconds**:\n   ```python\n   STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"door_key\"]).eventually(0, 30)\n   ```\n\n2. **Then go to the chest**:\n   ```python\n   STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"chest\"]).eventually(30, 100)\n   ```\n\n3. **Avoid all walls**:\n   ```python\n   STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"NE_inside_wall\"]).always(0, 100) &\n   STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"south_mid_inside_wall\"]).always(0, 100) &\n   STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"north_mid_inside_wall\"]).always(0, 100) &\n   STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"west_inside_wall\"]).always(0, 100) &\n   STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"above_door_wall\"]).always(0, 100)\n   ```\n\n4. **Stay in the room**:\n   ```python\n   STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"room_bounds\"]).always(0, 100)\n   ```\n\n5. **Do not go through the door before reaching the key**:\n   ```python\n   STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"door\"]).always(0, 30)\n   ```\n\nCombining all these parts together, we get the final STL specification:\n\n```python\n<STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"door_key\"]).eventually(0, 30) &\n STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"chest\"]).eventually(30, 100) &\n STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"NE_inside_wall\"]).always(0, 100) &\n STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"south_mid_inside_wall\"]).always(0, 100) &\n STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"north_mid_inside_wall\"]).always(0, 100) &\n STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"west_inside_wall\"]).always(0, 100) &\n STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"above_door_wall\"]).always(0, 100) &\n STL_formulas.inside_cuboid(objects[\"room_bounds\"]).always(0, 100) &\n STL_formulas.outside_cuboid(objects[\"door\"]).always(0, 30)>\n```\n\nThis specification ensures that the drone will follow all the given instructions."}]
